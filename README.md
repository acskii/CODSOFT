# Project Compilation - CODSOFT
Welcome to my humble repo where I collect all the tasks that were requested by the CODSOFT team during my time developing for their Python Programming Intership.

## Project 1 - Calculator
**Requested**:
```
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. 
Perform the calculation and display the results
```

*Key Features*:
- **Minimalist UI**: A clean, simple interface for ease of use.
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard input for seamless operation.
- **Comprehensive Operations**: Supports multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and modulus.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Includes Clear and Erase Previous functions for better control.
- **Precision Calculations**: Floating-point arithmetic for accuracy.

*Skills Gained*:
- Building intuitive user interfaces using tkinter.
- Efficient handling of user input and enabling keyboard controls.
- Strengthened problem-solving through debugging and code refinement.

## Project 2 - Contact Book
**Requested**: 
```
    Contact Information: Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.
    Add Contact: Allow users to add new contacts with their details.
    View Contact List: Display a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.
    Search Contact: Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.
    Update Contact: Enable users to update contact details.
    Delete Contact: Provide an option to delete a contact.
    User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
```

*Features*:
- Contact Management: Add, remove, and edit contact details seamlessly.
- Search Functionality: Filter contacts instantly using a search bar.
- Multiple Numbers: Store multiple phone numbers per contact.
- Contact Bio: Add a brief bio to personalize each contact.
- Themes: Support for dark and light modes.

*Skills Developed*:
- **Database Management**: Designed and optimized a suitable schema, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval, including support for multiple phone numbers.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented reliable Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities, ensuring data integrity and seamless database interactions.
- **Input Validation & Error Handling**: Ensured data accuracy and application stability through robust validation and error management techniques.

## Project 3 - Password Generator
**Requested**: 
```
      A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. 
      This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
      User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
      Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
      Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.
```

### How to setup?
1. **Download entire folder onto your drive/desktop.**
2. **Open Command Line**
> [!TIP]
> To open command line: search 'cmd', and hit Enter on first result.
3. **Change directory to program folder**
> [!NOTE]
> To change directory, type 'cd (destionation)', where destination is the folder you just installed.
4. **Type following command onto command line**
```python passgen.py```
5. **Program will run successfully!**

*Features*:
- **Password Length & Complexity Selection:** Users can customize the password length and complexity, including combinations of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Password Storage:** Generated passwords are stored in a local database for easy access later.
- **View Saved Passwords:** Users can view stored passwords anytime through the UI.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** A built-in copy feature allows users to quickly copy passwords for website registrations or logins.

*Skills Learned*:
- **Virtual Environments:** I ensured that the project uses a virtual environment, so anyone implementing it doesnâ€™t need to worry about third-party dependencies.
- **Classes & Clean Code:** The program is structured with classes to keep the code clean, modular, and reusable.
- **File Management:** Related classes are organized into folders, making the project easier to navigate and maintain.
